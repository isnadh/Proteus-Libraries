Proteus Libraries for missing components in database

First of all, download as zip any Proteus Library, letâ€™s use this Vibration Sensor Library for Proteus.

You will get a .rar file after download.

Open this .rar file and you will get three files in it, named as:
VibrationSensorTEP.LIB
VibrationSensorTEP.IDX
VibrationSensorTEP.HEX

These are the library files of this vibration sensor and you have to place these files in the Library folder of your Proteus software.

If you are using Windows 7, 8 or 10 then normally Proteus software is installed in the Program File (x86) folder, but it could be in Program File folder as well.

So, go to your C drive and then in both of these Program File folders, search for Labcenter Electronics.
This Labcenter Electronics folder is automatically generated by Proteus software.

Note:
Sometimes, it happens that Library folder is hidden, so if you are unable to find your Library folder then check your hidden folders too.
